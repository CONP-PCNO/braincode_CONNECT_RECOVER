# Overview

The Concussion Ontario Network: Neuroinformatics to Enhance Clinical care and Translation (CONNECT) is a collaborative network of 10 clinical sites across Ontario that aim to ensure new knowledge of concussion is translated into better diagnosis and care for the benefit of all Ontarians.  Given that the pathophysiology of concussion is largely unknown, a systems approach could provide a holistic framework for the study of concussion. Therefore, the overall purpose of the RECOVER pilot study is to demonstrate the ability to characterize ultra-early acute concussion in adults using a harmonized multi-scale system approach by collecting data that are potential predictors of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) over a 12- week period.
